      <p class="text_column">Michael De Santa, formerly Michael Townley, is one of the three protagonists in Grand Theft Auto V, along with Franklin Clinton and Trevor Philips.

However, he suffers from his unhealthy relationship with them, and soon gets pulled back into his criminal life, forcing him to return to his old ways. Michael's story centers around how his seemingly idyllic and halcyon lifestyle is brought to a halt as his past demons and morally compromising mistakes come back to haunt him. Meanwhile, his midlife crisis pushes him to his ultimate snapping point, and he becomes determined to achieve something more with his life, while also attempting to escape his past, become a free man and start a new life with his family. Michael is an old friend of fellow protagonist Trevor, and, early on in the storyline, he also befriends Franklin and becomes a mentor figure to him. He is the husband of Amanda, and the father of Jimmy and Tracey.&nbsp;</p>

      <h4>LESTER CREST&nbsp;</h4>
      <p class="tag">Lester Crest is a character in the Grand Theft Auto series who appears as a central character and the main deuteragonist in Grand Theft Auto V, and as a main character in Grand Theft Auto Online.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="text_column">Lester suffers from a wasting disease which has gradually worn down his motor skills during his life and left him wheelchair-bound, though he is able to walk short distances with the use of a cane. Due to his limited mobility, Lester has grown considerably overweight, and he also suffers from asthma. It is implied that Lester was bullied in high school, as he posted on Bleeter that "getting revenge" on his old high school class "never seemed to get old". Some time after he finished his studies, Lester applied for a faculty position at the University of San Andreas, Los Santos, but was not accepted. As an act of revenge, he hacked their systems. At an unknown point in time, Lester met and became affiliated with Michael Townley and Trevor Philips, becoming a regular member of their heist crews since the start of their partnership, working mostly as a planner and information scout. It is stated by Michael during The Merryweather Heist that Lester went against doing the heist depicted in the Prologue, possibly having an idea of what eventually happened.&nbsp;</p>

The PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC versions feature the Rockstar Editor, a tool allowing advanced movie production in various scenarios across Grand Theft Auto Online. The game is set in southern San Andreas in the United States and the island of Cayo Perico in the Caribbean coast of Colombia. The plot begins shortly before the events of Grand Theft Auto V,&nbsp; with all content updates from GTA Online: Heists to GTA Online: Import/Export taking place in 2013 (before the events of GTA V) . However, as the game released updates, the game's setting advanced in real-life timing, with all updates since GTA Online: Gunrunning taking place in their respective release years&nbsp;</p>
